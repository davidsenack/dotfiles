# Dotfiles

My dotfile setup using Vim, Tmux, and GNOME Terminal on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

### Install

To install, simply copy the dotfiles to your home directory and run
the package install script.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
Note: It may seem that the install of the dotfiles has failed. Make sure to restart
GNOME terminal.  

### Snapshot

To take a snapshot of the current system dotfiles run the snapshot script.

```bash
chmod +x snapshot.sh
./snapshot.sh
```
Each snapshot will be saved to the `snapshots` directory.

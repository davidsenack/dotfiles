# Dotfiles

My simple dotfile setup using Vim, Tmux, and Gnome Terminal on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

To install, simply copy the dotfiles to your home directory and run
the package install script.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
Note: It may seem that the install of the dotfiles has failed. Make sure to restart
GNOME terminal.
